Here you can find all my code used for the bbgg analysis.

The main file is the one named bbgg.C, which runs over the samples given as a parameter. It runs over the small ntuples saved in /afs/cern.ch/work/a/ariostas/public/bbgg/ . The small ntuples were created with the code found on the Selection folder.

To run use root bbgg.C+(\"name of background sample\")

In the Histograms folder you can find the output histograms and in Results.pdf you can find the event yields.
